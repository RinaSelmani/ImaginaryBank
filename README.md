# ImaginaryBank
project-imaginary-bank
Imaginary Bank is one android app that shows imaginary atm and bank branches. 
This android project is written in Kotlin language, the reason why I have chosen Kotlin language and not 
Java it it is the amount of code to be written in Kotlin is a lot less than Java .
I have user MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture for this project because itâ€™s the latest architecture type which gives 
 project the flexibility.
 To make activity and fragments communicate between each other I have user Event Bus library because it reduces the necessary code to make communication happen. 
To bind UI Components I have user Data binding which removes the findViewById process and makes easier to bind data to ui components. 
In order to show location list I have user Recycleview because is much better than ListView in performance and gives 
more manipulating options.
